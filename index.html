# Software Quality Control

---

## Verification & Validation

According to [Barry Boehm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Boehm):

* _Verification_: are we building the product right?
* _Validation_: are we building the right product?

This talk is about verification only.

---

## Verification

Two kinds of software verification:
* _static_: doesn't involve running the software (formal verification, linting...)
* _dynamic_: running the software and analysing its behaviour (tests)

This talk is about dynamic verification only.

---

## Testing

Tests are split into 3 phases:
* test input creation (_test case generation problem_)
* program evaluation
* output analysis (_oracle problem_)

# System Under Test

---

## FizzBuzz

Write a program that prints a given range of numbers.

But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`.

---

## Implementation

```scala
def div3(i: Int): Boolean = !(i % 3 > 0)
def div5(i: Int): Boolean = !(i % 5 > 0)

def fizzBuzz(i: Int): String = {
  if(div3(i))      "Fizz"
  else if(div5(i)) "Buzz"
  else             i.toString
}
```

---

class: center, middle

# Example-based testing

---

## Concept

Known scenarios are played, making sure the output is the expected one.

```scala
import org.scalatest.FunSuite

class SortSuite extends FunSuite {
  test("List.sorted sorts numbers") {
    assert(List(3, 2, 1).sorted == List(1, 2, 3))
  }
}

```

---

## FizzBuzz test suite

```scala
class FizzBuzzSuite extends FunSuite {
  test("n divisible by 3 outputs Fizz") {
    assert(fizzBuzz(3) == "Fizz")
  }

  test("n divisible by 5 outputs Buzz") {
    assert(fizzBuzz(5) == "Buzz")
  }

  test("n divisible by neither 3 or 5 outputs n") {
    assert(fizzBuzz(7) == "7")
  }
}
```

---

## FizzBuzz test suite .super[2]
```scala
new FizzBuzzSuite().execute()
// FizzBuzzSuite:
// - n divisible by 3 outputs Fizz
// - n divisible by 5 outputs Buzz
// - n divisible by neither 3 or 5 outputs n
```

---

## Client Demo

```scala
fizzBuzz(15)
// res1: String = Fizz
```

❌ _Expected `FizzBuzz`_

---

## Why did we fail?

* Lack of clear specifications
* Tester bias - we only tested what we implemented

---

## Clarifying specifications

Decision tables remove the specification ambiguity:

 n % 3 | n % 5 || Output
-------|-------||----------
 T     | T     || FizzBuzz
 T     | F     || Fizz
 F     | T     || Buzz
 F     | F     || n

* `n % 3` and `n % 5` are _conditions_
* `Output` is an _outcome_

---

## Fixing the implementation

```scala
def div3(i: Int): Boolean = !(i % 3 > 0)
def div5(i: Int): Boolean = !(i % 5 > 0)

def fizzBuzz(i: Int): String = {
  if(div3(i)) {
    if(div5(i)) "FizzBuzz"
    else        "Fizz"
  }
  else if(div5(i)) "Buzz"
  else             i.toString
}
```

---

## Fixing the tests

```scala
class FizzBuzzSuite extends FunSuite {
  test("n divisible by 3 outputs Fizz") {
    assert(fizzBuzz(3) == "Fizz")
  }

  test("n divisible by 5 outputs Buzz") {
    assert(fizzBuzz(5) == "Buzz")
  }

  test("n divisible by neither 3 or 5 outputs n") {
    assert(fizzBuzz(7) == "7")
  }

  test("n divisible by 3 and 5 outputs FizzBuzz") {
    assert(fizzBuzz(15) == "FizzBuzz")
  }
}
```

---

## Fixing the tests .super[2]

```scala
new FizzBuzzSuite().execute()
// FizzBuzzSuite:
// - n divisible by 3 outputs Fizz
// - n divisible by 5 outputs Buzz
// - n divisible by neither 3 or 5 outputs n
// - n divisible by 3 and 5 outputs FizzBuzz
```

---

## Client Demo

```scala
fizzBuzz(-3)
// res3: String = FizzBuzz
```

❌ _Expected `Fizz`_

---

## Failure 1: bias

Example-based tests are subject to their author's bias

Nowhere does this say our numbers can't be negative:

> Write a program that prints a given range of numbers.
> But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`.

---

## Failure 2: insufficient tests

`fizzBuzz`'s domain contains 4 294 967 295 elements.

We have tested *4*.

If we wrote one test every 5 seconds, it'd take approximately 27 years to write complete tests for `fizzBuzz`.

---

## Conclusions

Example-based testing is:

* great at the oracle problem
* about as bad as it gets for test case generation
* clearly insufficient

# Generative Testing

---

## Concept

Instead of running known scenarios, test on random data.

--

.section[Problem] how do you validate that the evaluation of a random input is correct?

---

## Property Based Testing

Test that the SUT's output doesn't violate important properties.

```scala
import org.scalacheck.Prop.forAll

val propAssociativity = forAll { (i: Int, j: Int, k: Int) =>
  i + (j + k) == (i + j) + k
}

val propCommutativity = forAll { (i: Int, j: Int) =>
  i + j == j + i
}

val propIdentity = forAll { (i: Int) =>
  i + 0 == i
}
```

---

## Problem with PBT

Most people come to PBT after years of experience with example-based testing.

As a result, they fall into 2 main traps and come to the conclusion that PBT is overrated.

Notable examples :
* [Dick Wall](https://twitter.com/dickwall), during an episode of Scalawags
* Me, for many, many years

---

## Trap 1: rewriting the SUT

```scala
val propFizzBuzz = forAll { (i: Int) =>
  if(div3(i)) {
    if(div5(i)) fizzBuzz(i) == "FizzBuzz"
    else        fizzBuzz(i) == "Fizz"
  }
  else if(div5(i)) fizzBuzz(i) == "Buzz"
  else             fizzBuzz(i) == i.toString
}
```

Likely to reproduce the bad behaviours we implemented the first time around.

---

## Trap 1: rewriting the SUT .super[2]

```scala
propFizzBuzz.check()
// + OK, passed 100 tests.
```

---

## Trap 2: forcing an oracle

```scala
import org.scalacheck._, Arbitrary.arbitrary

case class FizzBuzzTestCase(input: Int, expected: String)

implicit val arbFb: Arbitrary[FizzBuzzTestCase] = Arbitrary(
  arbitrary[Int].map { i =>
    FizzBuzzTestCase(
      i,
      if(div3(i)) {
        if(div5(i)) "FizzBuzz"
        else        "Fizz"
      }
      else if(div5(i)) "Buzz"
      else             i.toString
    )
  }
)
```

---

## Trap 2: forcing an oracle .super[2]

```scala
val propFizzBuzz = forAll { (test: FizzBuzzTestCase) =>
  fizzBuzz(test.input) == test.expected
}
```

```scala
propFizzBuzz.check()
// + OK, passed 100 tests.
```

---

## Strategies for identifying properties

Very often, SUTs will have properties that fall in a set of known categories.

Considering each category carefully usually leads to some interesting insights and properties.

---

## Test oracle

Do we have a correct but unsuitable implementation of the SUT?

```scala
def mySort[A: Ordering](as: List[A]): List[A] = ???

val propSorted = forAll { (is: List[Int]) =>
  mySort(is) == is.sorted
}
```

---

## Test oracle - use cases

Code refactoring / optimisation: use the old implementation as an oracle to prevent regressions

---

## Test oracle - FizzBuzz

Not really applicable for our `fizzBuzz` example.

--

(Or is it?)

---

## Validity

Is is it easy to check whether the SUT's output is valid (but not necessarily correct)?

```scala
val propValidAbs = forAll { (i: Int) =>
  math.abs(i) >= 0
}
```

---

## Validity - use cases

Sanity check against simple mistakes.

Search results: do all results actually match the search query?

Remember that errors are valid outputs too!

---

## Validity - FizzBuzz

```scala
val propValidFizzBuzz = forAll { (i: Int) =>
  Set(i.toString, "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz")
    .contains(fizzBuzz(i))
}
```

```scala
propValidFizzBuzz.check()
// + OK, passed 100 tests.
```

---

## Invertibility

Does the SUT have an inverse?


```scala
import io.circe._, io.circe.syntax._

val propEncodeDecode = forAll { (i: Int) =>
  i.asJson.as[Int] == Right(i)
}
```

---

## Invertibility - use cases

Encoder / decoder pairs

Persistence: creation *should* have deletion as an inverse

---

## Invertibility - FizzBuzz

`fizzBuzz` has an inverse on part of its domain.

```scala
val propInvertibleFizzBuzz = forAll { (i: Int) =>
  div3(i) || div5(i) || (fizzBuzz(i).toInt == i)
}
```

```scala
propInvertibleFizzBuzz.check()
// + OK, passed 100 tests.
```

--

.section[Note] there are better ways of writing partial properties

---

## Idempotence

Is the SUT idempotent?

```scala
val propSorted = forAll { (is: List[Int]) =>
  is.sorted == is.sorted.sorted
}
```

---

## Idempotence - use cases

A lot of CRUD operations are idempotent:
* updating something to a given value
* deleting a given object
* reading a given object / field
* ...

---

## Idempotence - FizzBuzz

```scala
val propIdempotentFizzBuzz = forAll { (i: Int) =>
  div3(i) ||
  div5(i) ||
  (fizzBuzz(fizzBuzz(i).toInt) == i.toString)
}
```

That's just invertibility in disguise though.

---

## Invariance

Does the SUT have a useful invariant?

```scala
val propStableSorted = forAll { (is: List[Int]) =>
  is.sorted.diff(is).isEmpty
}
```

---

## Invariance - use cases

Mutable systems, where precise assertions are hard.

[Real life example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi0rHwfiX1Q): _for all sequences of valid operations on a DB, the DB should never be corrupt_.

---

## Invariance - FizzBuzz

`fizzBuzz` doesn't really have a useful invariant that I can think of.

---

## Metamorphic property

Is there a couple of transformations such that applying one before the SUT and the other after doesn't change the outcome?

```scala
val propSorted = forAll { (is: List[Int]) =>
  is.map(x => -x).sorted.reverse == is.sorted.map(x => -x)
}
```

---

## Metamorphic property - use cases

Searches - for example, should results be different for a different sort order?

More on metamorphic properties in a few slides.

---

## Metamorphic property - FizzBuzz

```scala
import org.scalacheck.Prop.BooleanOperators

val propStableFizz = forAll { (i: Int) =>
 fizzBuzz(i).contains("Fizz") ==> fizzBuzz(-i).contains("Fizz")
}
```

```scala
propStableFizz.check()
// ! Falsified after 0 passed tests.
// > ARG_0: -1
// > ARG_0_ORIGINAL: -1810041971
```

---

## Fixing `fizzBuzz`

```scala
def div3(i: Int): Boolean = i % 3 == 0
def div5(i: Int): Boolean = i % 5 == 0

def fizzBuzz(i: Int): String = {
  if(div3(i)) {
    if(div5(i)) "FizzBuzz"
    else        "Fizz"
  }
  else if(div5(i)) "Buzz"
  else             i.toString
}
```

---

## Metamorphic property - FizzBuzz .super[2]

```scala
val propStableFizz = forAll { (i: Int) =>
 fizzBuzz(i).contains("Fizz") ==> fizzBuzz(-i).contains("Fizz")
}
```

```scala
propStableFizz.check()
// + OK, passed 100 tests.
```

---

## Challenge discovered properties

Once a property is identified, it's important to try and break it.

Try and provide a simple, flawed implementation of the SUT that breaks it.

Good candidates are properties with magic values, or SUTs that do the strict minimum.

```scala
def fizz(i: Int): String = {
  if(i % 3 == 0) "Fizz"
  else           i.toString
}
```

---

## Challenging FizzBuzz properties

```scala
class FizzBuzzSpecifications(sut: Int => String) extends
      Properties("FizzBuzz") {

  property("validity") = forAll { (i: Int) =>
    Set(i.toString, "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz")
      .contains(sut(i))
  }

  property("invertibility") = forAll { (i: Int) =>
    div3(i) || div5(i) || (sut(i).toInt == i)
  }

  property("stability") = forAll { (i: Int) =>
    sut(i).contains("Fizz") ==> sut(-i).contains("Fizz")
  }
}
```

---

## Challenging FizzBuzz properties .super[2]


```scala
new FizzBuzzSpecifications(fizz).check()
// + FizzBuzz.validity: OK, passed 100 tests.
// + FizzBuzz.invertibility: OK, passed 100 tests.
// + FizzBuzz.stability: OK, passed 100 tests.
```

Our `stability` property is hard-coded on `Fizz`.

---

## Challenging FizzBuzz properties .super[3]

```scala
class FizzBuzzSpecifications(sut: Int => String) extends
      Properties("FizzBuzz") {

  property("validity") = forAll { (i: Int) =>
    Set(i.toString, "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz")
      .contains(sut(i))
  }

  property("invertibility") = forAll { (i: Int) =>
    div3(i) || div5(i) || (sut(i).toInt == i)
  }

  property("stability") = forAll { (i: Int) =>
    (sut(i).contains("Fizz") ==> sut(-i).contains("Fizz")) &&
    (sut(i).contains("Buzz") ==> sut(-i).contains("Buzz"))
  }
}
```

---

## Challenging FizzBuzz properties .super[4]

We're now detecting the flaw:

```scala
new FizzBuzzSpecifications(fizz).check()
// + FizzBuzz.validity: OK, passed 100 tests.
// + FizzBuzz.invertibility: OK, passed 100 tests.
// ! FizzBuzz.stability: Gave up after only 0 passed tests. 501 tests were dis
//   carded.
```

---

## Conclusions

Property-based testing is:
* pretty amazing at the test case generation problem
* fairly good at the oracle problem
* require some practice to get the hang of

---

class: center, middle

# PBT, the easy way

---

## Specifications as oracle

We've seen that the easiest possible property was having an oracle.

If you squint, aren't decision tables both specifications and oracle?

---

## Decision tables as properties

 n % 3 | n % 5 || Output
-------|-------||----------
 T     | T     || FizzBuzz
 T     | F     || Fizz
 F     | T     || Buzz
 F     | F     || n

* _conditions_ are kind of a `Gen[Input]`
* _outcomes_ are kind of an oracle in the shape of `Input => Output`

---

## Decision tables as properties .super[2]

Stored as a CSV resource:

```scala
import kantan.dtables._, csv._, properties._

val spec: Specification =
  csv.load(getClass.getResource("/fizzbuzz.csv")).
    getOrElse(sys.error("Failed to load fizzbuzz specs"))
```

---

## Test case generation

We'll need a generator of FizzBuzz-relevant integers:

```scala
import org.scalacheck.Gen, Gen.choose

def makePrimish(i: Int): Int = {
  if(i % 3 == 0)      makePrimish(i / 3)
  else if(i % 5 == 0) makePrimish(i / 5)
  else                 i
}

val genPrimish: Gen[Int] =
  choose(Int.MinValue / 15, Int.MaxValue / 15).map(makePrimish)
```

---

## Decoding conditions

Conditions are loaded through a common decoding process:

```scala
implicit val conditionsDecoder: ConditionsDecoder[Int] =
  ConditionsDecoder.decoder("n % 3", "n % 5") {
    (div3: Boolean, div5: Boolean) =>
      genPrimish.map { i =>
        if(div3 && div5) i * 3 * 5
        else if(div3)    i * 3
        else if(div5)    i * 5
        else             i
      }
    }
```

---

## Decoding outcomes

So are outcomes:

```scala
implicit val outcomeDecoder: OutcomeDecoder[Int => String] =
  OutcomeDecoder.fromEntry[String]("Output").emap {
    case "n"        => DecodeResult.success(_.toString)
    case "Fizz"     => DecodeResult.success(_ => "Fizz")
    case "FizzBuzz" => DecodeResult.success(_ => "FizzBuzz")
    case "Buzz"     => DecodeResult.success(_ => "Buzz")
    case s          => DecodeResult.error(s)
  }
```

---

## Writing the test

```scala
import kantan.dtables.scalatest._

class FizzBuzzTest extends FunSuite with DTables {
  checkAll("FizzBuzz", spec) { (i: Int, f: Int => String) =>
    fizzBuzz(i) == f(i)
  }
}
```

```scala
new FizzBuzzTest().execute()
// FizzBuzzTest:
// - FizzBuzz.{n % 3: T, n % 5: T} => {Output: FizzBuzz}
// - FizzBuzz.{n % 3: T, n % 5: F} => {Output: Fizz}
// - FizzBuzz.{n % 3: F, n % 5: T} => {Output: Buzz}
// - FizzBuzz.{n % 3: F, n % 5: F} => {Output: n}
```

---

## Conclusions

Decision tables are:
* a good specification tool, when applicable
* a good property-based test tool, when available
--

* importantly, work that somebody else can do!

## Where to go from here?

PBT and MT do not need to know if a result is correct to work.

Could we run them in production?

* new _sanity_ metric: `properties violated / properties evaluated`
* rather than random inputs, _interesting_ inputs
